# Performing Arts Manager
Performing Arts Manager is a web app for managing your shows. It allows you to keep track of all parts of a performance, including actors, props, costumes, rehearsals, and more, all in a clean and easy to use interface.

## Tech Stack
- Database: MySQL. A relational database is ideal for this project because the data links are complex and highly structures. Sequelize will be used as an ORM for managing the relationships.
- Backend: Node.js + Express. This will serve as a RESTful API, handling database logic, user authentication (using JWT), permission checks, and serving data.
- Web Frontend: React.js. This will be used for the web-based frontend dashboards that have more complex criteria and should be accessed from a desktop.
- Mobile Frontend: React Native. A native mobile app will provide a better experience for team members to do basic tasks like schedules and assigned costumes. Allows for push notifications.
